      "description": "\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAfter about six years and a couple of entries in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/\"\u003eForza Horizon series\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-motorsport/\"\u003eForza Motorsport\u003c/a\u003e is making a comeback this year. The sim-racing franchise, focused on realism and professional tracks, will be one of Xbox's 2023 heavy hitters, but I'd been wondering what's actually new for this entry. As a long-time racing enthusiast dating back to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/gran-turismo/\"\u003efirst Gran Turismo\u003c/a\u003e, I've seen how the genre has evolved and, at points, stagnated. But from what I've seen so far, Forza Motorsport is fine-tuning the racing sim formula in smart ways by dialing in on two major areas: its career mode's gameplay loop and its driver AI behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFollowing the Xbox Games Showcase during Summer Game Fest, I was able to get a hands-off demo of Forza Motorsport and see the new sim racer in action. The emphasis was on the Builder's Cup Series, which is a career-style mode filled with racing events featuring certain conditions, restrictions, and challenges, as your typical sim-racing campaign would have. The key difference is in how progression works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInstead of racing to rack up money to spend on upgrades, you earn credits called Car Points, which is akin to XP or skill points in an RPG. Your allotment of Car Points lets you pick and choose which upgrades you want for your car without having to commit to them since you're not necessarily \"purchasing\" parts. Using certain car parts means spending Car Points to equip them, but if you switch it out to a better part or back to stock, you get the Car Points back. It's like being able to respec your character in an RPG without consequence. You're effectively creating a \"build\" for your car in the RPG sense, letting you spec out your car without buyer's remorse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-forza-motorsport-makes-smart-changes-to-career-mode-and-ai/1100-6515194/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\"\u003eContinue Reading at GameSpot\u003c/a\u003e",

      "description": "\u003cp\u003eRespawn Entertainment was hard at work on Titanfall 3 for 10 months before the project was canceled so that efforts could be focused on Apex Legends, a former developer at the studio has claimed. Speaking to \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/bIZXzkDpto4\"\u003eThe Burnettwork\u003c/a\u003e, former Titanfall and Call of Duty designer Mohammad Alavi said that the game was well into development before Respawn pulled the plug on it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Titanfall 2 came out, did what it did, and we were like 'Okay we're going to make Titanfall 3,\" Alavi said (via \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/titanfall-3-development\"\u003ePCGamesN\u003c/a\u003e). \"We worked on Titanfall 3 for 10 months in earnest. We had the tech for it, and multiple missions going.

A prototype was made, company-wide interest was ignited, and the studio began working on Apex Legends. \"We came back from break and we talked about it, and we were like 'we need to pivot,'\" Alavi said. \"We literally canceled Titanfall 3 ourselves because were like 'we can make this game and itâ€™ll be Titanfall 2 plus a little bit better, or we can make this thing which is clearly amazing.'\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-3-was-10-months-into-development-before-it-was-canceled-former-dev-claims/1100-6515174/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\"\u003eContinue Reading at GameSpot\u003c/a\u003e",

      "description": "\u003cp\u003eYou can soon preorder the first officially produced Atari 2600 new game cartridge in over 30 years. While a modernized version of the game will be coming to consoles and PC, action platformer Mr. Run And Jump will also get a limited-edition physical release exclusively on the classic console.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeveloper John Mikula, from indie studio Graphite Lab, originally created Mr. Run And Jump for 2600 hardware. The titular run-and-jump man must find his dog, Leap, before he wanders too far into the Dark realm. The Atari 2600 release will feature over 80 screens across six different worlds. The game has a speedrun emphasis, illustrated by its scoring system. You start with 25000 points; every second that passes decreases the score by one and every time you collide with an enemy, the score decreases by 100.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe limited-edition cartridge will cost $60 and comes with a box, an instruction manual, and of course, the cart itself. The carts are made from new parts and materials, with beveled edges for preventing pin damage and gold-plated connectors. They will also have identical power draw to the original cartridges, so you'll hopefully be able to play Mr. Run And Jump on original hardware without technical trouble. \u003ca href=\"https://atari.com/products/mr-run-and-jump-2600-limited-edition\"\u003ePreorders open on July 31\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-will-soon-produce-its-first-new-2600-cartridge-game-in-over-30-years/1100-6515173/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\"\u003eContinue Reading at GameSpot\u003c/a\u003e",
